# Week 2 Homework Assignment: Responsive Portfolio

This is three pages, making up a basic portfolio website using Bootstrap. In addition to Bootstrap components, I added a stylesheet of my own to incorporate some Google fonts, some padding, and various margins. There are screenshots of the pages in this repo, but I am confident you'll be able to see them with the link I uploaded to BootcampSpot.

**Built With**
- Bootstrap
- Google Fonts

**Bootstrap components**
  1. Navbar with branding
  2. Form on the contact page
  3. Responsive grid design with no media inquiries required.
